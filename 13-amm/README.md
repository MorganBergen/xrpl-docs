#### What do automated market makers (AMMs) do?

Automtaed market makers are systems that let you exchange assets without needing a middle man.  Each AMM holds a pool of two assets and enables users to swap between them at an exchange rate set by a formula.  They're the most common way to implement a decentralized exchange to allow everyday traders to exchange assets of various sorts for fair rates.  The main alternative to AMMs are the Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs).
