#### What do automated market makers (AMMs) do?

Automtaed market makers are systems that let you exchange assets without needing a middle man.  Each AMM holds a pool of two assets and enables users to swap between them at an exchange rate set by a formula.  They're the most common way to implement a decentralized exchange to allow everyday traders to exchange assets of various sorts for fair rates.  The main alternative to AMMs are the Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs).  

#### How do AMMs work?

At its heart, an AMM works by pooling two tokens together in a pair of liquidity pools.  Oncce enough currency is pooled together, the AMM automatically picks a fiar exchange rate bwteen the different currencies.  AMM's figure out the fair exchange rate with a powerful formula called a "constant function formula" which tries to model the price that a traditional market would discover on its own.  Liquidity pools are handy for two reasons.  First, because the prices are chosen automatically, everyday token holders can contirbute without having to know what a "fair" exchange rate is.  They're also useful because they can provide constant liquidity as the pool is always willing to trade.  Think of it like the exchnage rate that is always available at your bank.

#### Automated pricing and continuous trading

As people trade within the pool, the AMM's algorithm adjusts the prices of the assets to keep everything in balance.  If one asset is in high demand, its price goes up, an dthe other asset's price drops.  This algoirthm uses the constant function formula to keep things in balance.
