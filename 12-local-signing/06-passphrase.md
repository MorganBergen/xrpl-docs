The Diceware Passphrase Home Page
This page offers a better way to create a strong, yet easy to remember, passphrase for use with encryption and security programs. Weak passwords and passphrases are one of the most common flaws in computer security. Take a few minutes and learn how to do it right. The information presented here can be used by anyone. No background in cryptography or mathematics is required. Just follow the simple steps below. (If you'd like to know even more about passphrases, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), and please checkout the Diceware Security Blog, for commentary on the latest developments in computer security and shared secret authentication.)

This page is also available in Chinese, Esperanto, Finnish, French, Italian, Japanese, Polish and Spanish. There are also Diceware word lists available in  Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Maori, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish, 29 languages besides English, all kindly contributed by our users.

What Is A Passphrase?
A passphrase is a bunch of words and characters that you type in to your computer to let it know for sure that the person typing is you. Most security programs allow you to enter a passphrase instead of just a short password for added protection against attackers. Some programs also use your passphrase to form a cryptographic key to encrypt your data.

Since so many sites allow you to reset your password with just e-mail verification, protecting your login or email account is critical. The latest versions of popular operating systems, including Windows, MacOS and Linux, let you use longer passphrases for log-on identification.
Popular password manager programs require a master password or passphrase to protect the data they store.
Digital currencies, such as BitCoin, use passphrases to protect the “coins” from misappropriation.
Passphrases are used with Wi-Fi wireless network security systems such as WPA and WPA2, when used in personal shared key (PSK) mode. The security of both systems depends on the strength of the passphrase you chose.
Phil Zimmermann's popular encryption program PGP requires you to make up a passphrase that you enter whenever you sign or decrypt messages. So does the open-source version, GnuPG.
Passphrases are used with disk encryption programs such as PGPdisk and Apple's FileVault. Many organizations require disk encryption on laptops to meet regulatory requirements for protecting sensitive information.
Using a short passphrase as an answer to a required "security question" (like "What city were you born in?") protects you against attempts to discover your answer by researching your online data.

Follow the Diceware™ instructions here to create your passphrase before installing a WiFi router, creating your GPG key, opening a new security account or setting up an encrypted disk or cryptocurrency wallet, so you'll be ready when asked to enter your new password.

Passphrases differ from passwords only in length. Passwords are usually short, six to twelve characters. Short passwords can be cracked if the databases that organizations use to store validation data are stolen, which happens all too often. Passphrases are usually much longer – typically 25 to 64 characters (including spaces). Their greater length makes passphrases more secure. Modern passphrases were invented by Sigmund N. Porter in 1981.

Picking a good passphrase is one of the most important things you can do to preserve the privacy of your computer data and e-mail messages. A passphrase should be:

Known only to you
Long enough to be secure
Hard to guess – even by someone who knows you well
Easy for you to remember
Easy for you to type accurately

What Is Diceware?
Diceware™ is a method for picking passphrases that uses ordinary dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.

Here is a short excerpt from the English Diceware word list:

 16655 clause
 16656 claw
 16661 clay
 16662 clean
 16663 clear
 16664 cleat
 16665 cleft
 16666 clerk
 21111 cliche
 21112 click
 21113 cliff
 21114 climb
 21115 clime
 21116 cling
 21121 clink
 21122 clint
 21123 clio
 21124 clip
 21125 clive
 21126 cloak
 21131 clock
The complete list contains 7776 short words, abbreviations and easy-to-remember character strings. The average length of each word is about 4.2 characters. The biggest words are six characters long. The English list is based on a longer word list posted to the Internet news group sci.crypt by Peter Kwangjun Suk. An alternative list, edited by Alan Beale, contains fewer Americanisms and obscure words. And there are lists for many other languages. You can also download the Diceware word list in PDF format or in PostScript format.

Using Diceware
To use the Diceware list you will need one or more ordinary, six-sided dice. Dice come with many board games and are sold separately at toy, hobby, and magic stores, as well as online. Braille dice are also available. You can purchase a set of five casino-grade dice online from Amazon.com or Ebay.com for about $13, but they are overkill for this purpose. Do not use a computer program or electronic dice generator. There is no easy way to be sure they are random enough.

Download the complete Diceware list, the alternative Beale list or a list in the language of your choice, and save it on your computer. Print it out if you like. Then return to this page.
Decide how many words you want in your passphrase. A five word passphrase provides a level of security much higher than the simple passwords most people use. We recommend a minimum of six words for use with GPG, wireless security and file encryption programs. A seven, eight or nine word passphrase is recommended for high value uses such as whole disk encryption, BitCoin, and the like. For more information, see the Diceware FAQ.
Now roll the dice and write down the results on a slip of paper. Write the numbers in groups of five. Make as many of these five-digit groups as you want words in your passphrase. You can roll one die five times or roll five dice once, or any combination in between. If you do roll several dice at a time, read the dice from left to right.
Look up each five digit number in the Diceware list and find the word next to it. For example, 21124 means your next passphrase word would be "clip" (see the excerpt from the English list, above).
When you are done, the words that you have found are your new passphrase. Memorize them and then either destroy the scrap of paper or keep it in a really safe place. That's all there is to it!

Example
Suppose you want a six word passphrase, as we recommend for most users. You will need 6 times 5 or 30 dice rolls. Let's say they come out as:

 1, 6, 6, 6, 5, 1, 5, 6, 5, 3, 5, 6, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 
 1, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 6. 
Write down the results on a scrap of paper in groups of five rolls:

 1 6 6 6 5 
 1 5 6 5 3 
 5 6 3 2 2 
 3 5 6 1 6
 6 5 2 2 4 
 6 4 3 2 6
You then look up each group of five rolls in the Diceware word list by finding the number in the list and writing down the word next to the number:

 1 6 6 6 5 cleft
 1 5 6 5 3 cam
 5 6 3 2 2 synod
 3 5 6 1 6 lacy
 6 5 2 2 4 yr
 6 4 3 2 6 wok
Your passphrase would then be:

 cleft cam synod lacy yr wok
Some Tips
For maximum security make sure you are alone and close the curtains. Write on a hard surface – not on a pad of paper. After you memorize your passphrase, burn your notes, pulverize the ashes and flush them down the toilet.
If you are using a passphrase for file encryption, we recommend you keep a copy written down in a safe place. If you don't and you forget your passphrase, your files are lost forever.
If you want to work from a printed copy of the English word list, download the the Diceware word list in PDF format or PostScript format. These files are formatted with 4 columns and 54 lines per page. You will get a neat, 36 page printout in which the first two dice throws are the same for each page. This makes look-ups especially easy. If you prefer a more compact printout, here is an 11-page version from Patrick Feisthammel. Be careful not to mark the printed copy in any way while you are selecting words. You can also find the word list as an Appendix to Internet Secrets.
If you need to make up passphrases often, get a shoe box or a food storage box about the same size. Put five dice in the box, shake them up vigorously – at least ten hard shakes – and then tip the box to let all the dice slide down to one edge. Now open the box, read the dice from left to right, or front to back if a few line up. Then just look up the corresponding word list entry. Repeat this process until you have enough words for your passphrase.
We recommend that you use the passphrase exactly as generated. If you want a stronger passphrase, select an additional word using the diceware method.
Because some words on the diceware list are two characters or less, it’s possible to get a very short passphrase. If your passphrase, including the spaces between the words, is less than 19 characters long, we recommend that you start over and create a new passphrase. You should also start over if your passphrase is a recognizable sentence or phrase in the language you are using. (These situations are extremely rare.)
See the Diceware FAQ for suggestions on how to memorize your passphrase.

Optional stuff you don't really need to know
For extra security without adding another word, insert one special character or digit chosen at random into your passphrase. Here is how to do this securely: Roll one die to choose a word in your passphrase, roll again to choose a letter in that word. Roll a third and fourth time to pick the added character from the following table:

 Third Roll
        
    1 2 3 4 5 6
F 1 ~ ! # $ % ^
o 2 & * ( ) - =
u 3 + [ ] \ { }
r 4 : ; " ' < >
t 5 ? / 0 1 2 3
h 6 4 5 6 7 8 9
For the technically inclined, each word in your Diceware passphrase yields 12.9 bits of entropy, the way passphrase security is measured. A five word Diceware passphrase would have an entropy of at least 64.6 bits; six words would have 77.5 bits, seven words 90.4 bits, eight words 103.2 bits. Inserting a letter at random adds about 10 bits of entropy. All this assumes, of course, that you actually keep your passphrase a secret.
You'll find a lot more information you don't really need to know in the Diceware FAQ.

Why Diceware?
There are many different recommendations available on the Internet about how to pick a passphrase. Some are good, a few are bad, but almost all require the user to judge what will be hard for someone else to guess. Some give no guidance on how to do that, others have you make complex mathematical calculations. By contrast, the Diceware method of generating passphrases is:

Easy to learn and use
Very secure
Totally prescriptive – we tell you exactly what to do at each step of the process
Transparent – there are no "trust me"s
Free – there is no computer software or hardware required, just the Diceware wordlist and some ordinary dice

The prescriptive nature of Diceware is very important for new users of encryption. Here is one person's experience, as posted to the Internet newsgroup alt.security.pgp:

"I just wanted to relate a personal story about how hard it is to convince a novice how important it is to select a secure password, and get them to understand what constitutes a secure password. I am an old-timer at both the Internet and security issues. My sister, however, is brand new to it having just opened an Internet account. She lives in [the mid-west] while I live [on the west coast]. As a result, we exchange quite a bit of very personal email.
Recently, she wanted to give her Internet password to her husband so that he could get on line. However, she still wanted to be able to exchange private messages with me that he would not be able to read. I, of course, introduced her to PGP.
I gave her the usual lecture about how important it is to select a password that nobody else can easily guess, and that the ideal password would be some obscure and nonsense word that would have meaning only to her. I told her all about not selecting birthdays, anniversaries, names, and the like. I didn't suggest a random combination of letters and numbers because we were not after world class security, we just wanted to keep her husband out of our private letters. So, after she selected her PGP password, I decided to give it a try at cracking it. The VERY FIRST password I tried worked! She was totally surprised at how easily I had found it, but it was a word that anyone knowing her would have access to. So, after giving her some more tips on good password selection, I let her try again. This time, it took me only 3 attempts before I found the right word. Finally, she gave up and let me pick a password for her."
Had she used Diceware, the author's sister's very first passphrase would have been totally secure and known only to her. Remember: in public key cryptography, the security of your message depends on the recipient's passphrase. Spread the word about Diceware!

Other English word lists
A number of other groups have developed English word lists for generating passphrases. Here are a couple:

Electronic Frontier Foundation
In July 2016, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) published a new list. Their long list contains 7776 words, so its security is exactly the same as the Diceware word list. “The words in our [the EFF's] list are longer (7.0 characters) on average, than Reinhold's Diceware list (4.3 characters). This is a result of banning words under 3 characters as well as prioritizing familiar words over short but unusual words.” Here is a sample random EFF passphrase:

foundling confess henna figure congrats revival
I still think having a short passphrase is worth the bother of learning an unfamiliar word or remembering simple strings such as nnnn or xg, but the choice is purely a matter of taste, not security. Note that the EFF says it has screened its word list to remove all potentially offensive words. I attempted to excluded the worst obscenities and racial slurs, but there are words in my list that have dual meanings in English slang and it is possible that a randomly generated passphrase could have offensive meaning. Pick a word list that works for you.

Natural Language Passwords
Mogura Sama has developed a variation on Diceware which uses separate lists of English adjectives and nouns. He calls it Natural Language Passwords (NLP). The idea is to generate word pairs that are more meaningful than individual words. His noun list is the same size as standard Diceware lists, 6^5 or 7776 words. His adjective list has 1296 words, 6^4, so only four dice rolls are needed to select an adjective. This means each adjective contributes 10.3 bits of entropy, compared to 12.9 for his nouns or regular Diceware words. A six-word NLP password, three adjective-noun pairs, would have 69.8 bits of entropy, compared to 77.5 bits for a six-word Diceware passphrase. One way to make up the difference is to select a fourth adjective and place it where it seems to make the most sense. Here is a random example with the extra adjective (light in this case):

     yawning laptops smug dentists sleazy light mime
Again, pick a method that works for you.
